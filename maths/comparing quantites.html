    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Comparing quantities is essential in our day-to-day lives. It helps us understand how much one quantity differs from another, be it prices, measurements, or even scores. The most common ways to compare quantities are using ratios, percentages, and proportions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Ratios</h2>
    <p>
        A ratio is a way of comparing two quantities by division. It shows how many times one quantity is as compared to another.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Ratio of two numbers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is written as a:b or a/b.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> If there are 3 apples and 5 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:5.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Percentages</h2>
    <p>
        Percentages represent a part of a whole, out of 100. It is used widely in daily life, such as calculating discounts, interest rates, or population growth.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Percentage = (Value / Total) × 100</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> If 25 out of 100 students are girls, the percentage of girls is (25/100) × 100 = 25%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Proportions</h2>
    <p>
        A proportion shows that two ratios are equivalent. If two ratios are equal, they are said to be in proportion.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> If 4/8 = 6/12, these ratios are in proportion because both simplify to 1/2.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Applications of Comparing Quantities</h2>
    <p>
        Comparing quantities has practical applications in various fields, such as:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Profit and Loss:</strong> Profit or loss is calculated based on the cost price and selling price of an item.</li>
            <li><strong>Discounts:</strong> Discounts are reductions on the original price and are usually given as a percentage.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple Interest:</strong> Interest earned on an amount of money over time, calculated using the formula <strong>Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100</strong>, where P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest, and T = Time.</li>
            <li><strong>Compound Interest:</strong> Interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>6. Profit and Loss</h2>
    <p>
        Profit occurs when the selling price (SP) is greater than the cost price (CP). Loss occurs when the selling price is less than the cost price.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profit:</strong> Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)</li>
        <li><strong>Loss:</strong> Loss = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)</li>
        <li><strong>Profit Percentage:</strong> (Profit / CP) × 100</li>
        <li><strong>Loss Percentage:</strong> (Loss / CP) × 100</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Simple Interest</h2>
    <p>
        Simple Interest is calculated on the original principal for a fixed time period and interest rate.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> For a principal amount of ₹1000, at a 5% interest rate over 2 years, SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = ₹100.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Compound Interest</h2>
    <p>
        Compound Interest is calculated on both the principal and the interest accumulated over previous periods.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> A = P(1 + R/100)<sup>T</sup>, where A is the amount, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> If ₹1000 is invested at 5% interest compounded annually for 2 years, the amount will be A = 1000(1 + 5/100)<sup>2</sup> = ₹1102.5.</li>
    </ul>
