    <h2>1. Introduction to Lines</h2>
    <p>
        A line is a straight one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions. It is defined by two points on a plane and has no thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Types of Lines:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Line:</strong> A straight path that extends endlessly in both directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Line Segment:</strong> A part of a line that has two definite endpoints.</li>
            <li><strong>Ray:</strong> A part of a line that starts from a fixed point and extends infinitely in one direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel Lines:</strong> Lines that are equidistant from each other and never meet, no matter how far they are extended.</li>
            <li><strong>Perpendicular Lines:</strong> Two lines that intersect at a right angle (90°).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Angles</h2>
    <p>
        An angle is formed when two rays meet at a common point called the vertex. The measure of an angle is given in degrees (°).
    </p>
    <p>
        Types of Angles:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Acute Angle:</strong> An angle that measures less than 90°.</li>
            <li><strong>Right Angle:</strong> An angle that measures exactly 90°.</li>
            <li><strong>Obtuse Angle:</strong> An angle that measures more than 90° but less than 180°.</li>
            <li><strong>Straight Angle:</strong> An angle that measures exactly 180°, forming a straight line.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflex Angle:</strong> An angle that measures more than 180° but less than 360°.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete Angle:</strong> An angle that measures exactly 360°, forming a full circle.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Pairs of Angles</h2>
    <p>
        When two lines intersect, different pairs of angles are formed. These include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complementary Angles:</strong> Two angles whose measures add up to 90°.</li>
            <li><strong>Supplementary Angles:</strong> Two angles whose measures add up to 180°.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjacent Angles:</strong> Two angles that have a common vertex and a common side, but do not overlap.</li>
            <li><strong>Vertically Opposite Angles:</strong> Angles formed when two lines intersect. Vertically opposite angles are always equal.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Transversal and Corresponding Angles</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>transversal</strong> is a line that crosses two or more parallel lines. The angles formed between a transversal and parallel lines are called <strong>corresponding angles</strong>.
        <br>For example:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Corresponding Angles:</strong> Angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection where a transversal crosses two parallel lines. Corresponding angles are always equal.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternate Interior Angles:</strong> Angles on opposite sides of the transversal but inside the parallel lines. These angles are always equal.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternate Exterior Angles:</strong> Angles on opposite sides of the transversal but outside the parallel lines. These angles are also equal.</li>
            <li><strong>Co-interior Angles:</strong> Angles on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines. These angles add up to 180°.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Measuring Angles</h2>
    <p>
        Angles are measured in degrees (°) using a protractor.
        <ul>
            <li>To measure an angle, align the base of the protractor with one side of the angle and read the number on the protractor where the other side intersects.</li>
            <li>Acute, obtuse, and reflex angles can be measured using the inner or outer scale of the protractor.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
